# DeetsMusic — project guide for Claude

A lightweight Apple Music player for Windows 11 (Tauri v2 + WebView2, vanilla TS
front-end, Rust back-end).

## Start here
- **`docs/HANDOFF.md`** — cold-start: state of play, how to run, roadmap, gotchas.
- `docs/UI-ARCHITECTURE.md` — front-end (token/theme/skin system, collection-card engine).
- `docs/DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md` — auth, model, provider, SQLite cache.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — product intent.
- `docs/TRAY.md` — tray icon/panel + minimize-to-tray; `docs/EXTENSION.md` — browser
  extension + the loopback bridge (`extension/` is the MV3 source); `docs/AGENT.md` —
  the agent/CLI routes on that bridge; `docs/RELEASE.md` — build, install, uninstall.

## How to verify your work
- **The user runs the app and tests your changes** (`npm run tauri dev`) and gives
  feedback. **Do NOT build throwaway test harnesses, mock pages, or one-off tooling to
  verify UI behavior** — it wastes time/tokens. Make the change, sanity-check it
  compiles, then hand it to the user to try.
- Cheap checks that ARE worth running (not harnesses): `npx tsc --noEmit` and
  `npx vite build` to catch type/compile/bundle errors before handing off.
- If something genuinely can't be reasoned through and the user is away, ask them to
  test rather than scaffolding a harness.

## Working style (the user directs the architecture)
- For non-trivial features, **design on paper / talk it through first**, surface the
  real forks (he responds well to multiple-choice), confirm, then build.
- **Everything is token-based**: never hardcode a color, px, font, or motion value in a
  component — add/route through the palette → theme → skin tiers. Color → theme role;
  geometry/type/spacing/motion → skin token.
- He values polish and good stewardship (e.g. minimize Apple API calls; ask cost before
  committing to a fetch-heavy approach).
- **Do NOT delegate to subagents (the `Agent` tool) for this codebase.** It's small
  enough to hold in context directly — explore, read, and edit files yourself so you
  keep the full picture while building. Only exception: if he explicitly asks for one.

## How to explain things to me
- Write in ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English): short sentences, active
  voice, one idea per sentence, plain approved words, no metaphor.
- Name the exact control or gesture ("the tray icon", "the pinned taskbar
  button"). Define the terms once, at the start.
- Test each option against the code BEFORE you show it to me. Discard the
  options that the code already rules out. Show the real forks only.
- A question about the UI needs the front-end state, not only the Rust. Check
  localStorage keys and the `surface`/`theme`/`skin` modules first.

## Run
```
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # compiles Rust (first run slow), opens the 480×864 window
npm run dev:app       # same, isolated from the INSTALLED app (own identifier/data dir)
npm run release       # build the installer (→ installers/; see docs/RELEASE.md)
npx tsc --noEmit      # front-end typecheck
```
Devtools auto-open in dev (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).

## Conventions
- Front-end only ever sees the normalized model (`Track`/`Album`/…), never raw Apple
  shapes — normalization lives in Rust.
- Commit only when the user asks. Co-author trailer:
