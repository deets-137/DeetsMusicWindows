# DeetsMusic — project guide for Claude

A lightweight Apple Music player for Windows 11 (Tauri v2 + WebView2, vanilla TS
front-end, Rust back-end).

## Start here
- **`docs/HANDOFF.md`** — cold-start: state of play, how to run, roadmap, gotchas.
- `docs/UI-ARCHITECTURE.md` — front-end (token/theme/skin system, collection-card engine).
- `docs/DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md` — auth, model, provider, SQLite cache.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — product intent.

## How to verify your work
- **The user runs the app and tests your changes** (`npm run tauri dev`) and gives
  feedback. **Do NOT build throwaway test harnesses, mock pages, or one-off tooling to
  verify UI behavior** — it wastes time/tokens. Make the change, sanity-check it
  compiles, then hand it to the user to try.
- Cheap checks that ARE worth running (not harnesses): `npx tsc --noEmit` and
  `npx vite build` to catch type/compile/bundle errors before handing off.
- If something genuinely can't be reasoned through and the user is away, ask them to
  test rather than scaffolding a harness.

## Working style (the user directs the architecture)
- For non-trivial features, **design on paper / talk it through first**, surface the
  real forks (he responds well to multiple-choice), confirm, then build.
- **Everything is token-based**: never hardcode a color, px, font, or motion value in a
  component — add/route through the palette → theme → skin tiers. Color → theme role;
  geometry/type/spacing/motion → skin token.
- He values polish and good stewardship (e.g. minimize Apple API calls; ask cost before
  committing to a fetch-heavy approach).

## Run
```
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # compiles Rust (first run slow), opens the 480×864 window
npx tsc --noEmit      # front-end typecheck
```
Devtools auto-open in dev (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).

## Conventions
- Front-end only ever sees the normalized model (`Track`/`Album`/…), never raw Apple
  shapes — normalization lives in Rust.
- Commit only when the user asks. Co-author trailer:
