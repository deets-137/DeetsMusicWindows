# Release notes

The text for each GitHub Release. Newest first. Plain words, for the person installing.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-12

**Favorites.** Right-click a song › Favorite. The ♥ syncs with Apple Music. The Library has
a "Favorites only" filter.

**Faster start.** A song starts sooner after a click. The queue comes back after a restart.

**Songs Apple Music no longer offers are skipped.** DeetsMusic remembers them for 7 days,
then tries them again.

**Copy Link.** Right-click a song or an album › Copy Link. The link opens in Apple Music.

**Also new:** local playlist covers, pinned searches, a weekly Replay, smooth theme and
skin changes, Now Playing text in the album's colors, and a Glass "Play on" panel.

### Installing

- **Windows SmartScreen will warn you.** The installer is not code-signed yet. Click
  **More info**, then **Run anyway**. The installer is per-user and asks for no admin rights.
- Quit any AI app that is connected to DeetsMusic before you install an update; it keeps a
  file open that the installer must replace.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-10

A fix for 0.2.0: the first speaker connect on an installed build now asks for the Windows
firewall permission it needs. (0.2.0 could skip the prompt and then fail with "Couldn't
reach".)

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-10

**Play on a HomePod.** Click the AirPlay square next to the volume slider and pick a speaker.
The volume slider then controls the speaker, and the speaker starts at 20 % the first time.
The HomePod's touch surface and Siri control playback. The Home app on an iPhone shows the
song and its cover. The PC keeps playing too in this version.

**Control from an AI app or the command line.** Settings › Agents. Claude Desktop, Claude
Code, Cursor and any local MCP app can play, pause, search, queue and read what is playing.
"Copy setup for" gives you the exact text to paste. The guide is
[docs/AGENT-SETUP.md](AGENT-SETUP.md). Turn it off with one switch.

**Start with Windows.** Settings › Window. Starts in the tray at sign-in.

### Installing

- **Windows SmartScreen will warn you.** The installer is not code-signed yet. Click
  **More info**, then **Run anyway**. The installer is per-user and asks for no admin rights.
- **One Windows permission prompt on the first speaker connect.** Speakers reply over the
  network on their own, and Windows blocks that until it has a rule. DeetsMusic asks once.
- Windows 11. An Apple Music subscription. Sign in from the title menu › Account.
- Quit any AI app that is connected to DeetsMusic before you install an update; it keeps a
  file open that the installer must replace.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-09-09

First installer line: one instance only, the tray flyout, the browser extension, the
`deetsmusic` CLI and MCP server.
