# DeetsMusic — Handoff / Status

> Cold-start guide — read first. A lightweight Apple Music player for Windows 11:
> **Tauri v2 + WebView2**, vanilla **TypeScript** front-end, **Rust** back-end. Current
> surface is the **midi-player** (480×864 frameless window) showing a home **bento** of cards.
>
> **Where things stand:** the foundation (playback, queue, card/slot system, themes/skins,
> library + catalog data) and the feature cards (Library, Search, Playlists, Queue, History,
> Rewind, **Radio** incl. seeded right-click "Start Station") are built and user-verified.
> **The Apple-radio line is done.** Next: the **v1 push** — see [Next up](#next-up).

## Run it

Prereqs (one-time, already set up on this machine): **Rust** (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) + **VS
2022 Build Tools** (C++ workload, for `link.exe`); **Node** + npm; **Apple Developer** creds in
`src-tauri/secrets/` (`apple.json`, the `.p8`, and a captured `user-token.txt` — launches
already signed in).

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev        # compiles Rust (first run slow), opens the window
npx tsc --noEmit         # typecheck front-end
npx vite build           # bundle-check
```

Devtools **auto-open in dev** (`lib.rs` setup). Debug the player in the console:
`__diag.dump()` / `__diag.copy()` (ring buffer of transport + MusicKit events + desyncs,
auto-captures uncaught errors), `__music` (live instance), `__player.snap()`. Full reference:
[DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md).

## Next up

**The v1 push** — sequence discussed 2026-07-03 (each item still wants its own design/confirm
pass before building; the user directs):
1. **Settings card** — a lean vessel that rehomes the existing title-menu toggles
   (Always-on-Top / Hover-Menu / Library-Add) and seeds a curated handful of
   [FUTURE-SETTINGS](FUTURE-SETTINGS.md) entries (§1 / §4 / §5a / §7 are the
   highest-taste-variance). Explicitly NOT a full ledger burn-down.
2. **Release packaging** — secrets/cache out of `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` into proper app dirs,
   MUT into Windows Credential Manager, an installable build (the one true v1 blocker).
3. **SMTC / global hotkeys** — media keys + the Windows media flyout.

**Deferred, when prioritized:** the **search-card stations section** (the one optional radio
leftover — add `stations` to the search types; `Station` model/tile/playback all exist, activation
is just `playStation`) · the **radio-mode now-playing/queue UX** (a holistic pass — what the
Qcard/NP surface does while a station plays; also owns **Stop Station**'s button, since
`stopStation()` exists but is currently unwired) · **DeetsWeather** ([DeetsWeather.md](DeetsWeather.md);
its own-station premise needs a rethink — that engine was dropped) · **CLI / local-agent
control** · **mini/max surface compositions** · **virtualized scrolling** (only once libraries
get large).

## State of play

### Built ✅
- **Frameless chrome**: custom titlebar, drag region, traffic lights wired to min/max/close.
- **Themes** (palette → theme → skin, all CSS-variable driven): `fairy`, `glade`, `sepia`,
  `moonlight`, `hornet`, `viper`. Settings menu (click the title) with Theme + Skin flyouts,
  Account row, Always-on-Top / Hover-Menu / Library-Add toggles.
- **Skins**: `vanilla` (borderless + editorial underline), `desk` (paper cards), `ocean`
  (recessed waves), `glass` (frosted, drifting aurora), `cyberstorm` (lightning storm layer).
  Shared `[data-skin]` base + per-skin deltas; nav/motion/geometry fully tokenized (new
  capabilities like `--hover-lift` / `--panel-backdrop` default to no-ops).
- **Card + slot system** (`cards.ts`, `layout.ts`; [SURFACES-AND-CARDS.md](SURFACES-AND-CARDS.md)):
  every card is a mountable registry module. Midi bento = anchored **Now Playing** + **two
  swappable content slots**, each slot's **title is a card picker** (persisted, root-only).
  **Surface seam** (`data-surface` mini/midi/max) exists with size-band resize + per-surface
  remembered sizes; mini/max inherit the midi layout until composed.
- **Apple auth**: loopback browser sign-in (themed page), MUT persisted across restarts.
- **Playback** (the load-bearing DRM risk is dead — full-song plays in WebView2): `player.ts`
  configures MusicKit JS in the webview, injects the captured MUT directly (no `authorize()`
  popup), plays. Live drag-to-seek scrubber + volume (shared `slider.ts`, persisted). Catalog→
  library id fallback; **dead-id self-healing** (stale catalog ids don't sink a feed batch).
- **Queue model** (`queue.ts`, [QUEUE.md](QUEUE.md)): history / current / upcoming of lightweight
  handles; origin-based stacking (manual picks survive a new context); backgrounded pre-click
  backlog reachable via Previous. Player keeps it **live-synced to MusicKit** (model-follow) and
  feeds MusicKit a bounded **window** with gapless **re-windowing** (forward top-up +
  Previous-past-the-edge). Manual queueing (Play Now/Next/Add) + Up-Next drag-reorder, all gapless.
- **Data**: `library_sync` pulls all songs → SQLite → **collection-card engine**
  (`collection-card.ts`) with per-context Sort/View/Search. **Lazy catalog enrichment**
  (`enrich.rs`) pulls only what you touch (palette / ISRC / previews ride every fetch). Unified
  `tracks` store on the catalog-first key (`seen`→`library` graduation). **Play-event log**
  (`play_events`, real `ms_listened`) — the un-backfillable clock is running.
- **Feature cards** (all on the collection-card engine unless noted):
  - **Library** — Songs / Albums / Artists (albums/artists derived from songs), drill-in, click
    a song to play + queue the rest in sort order. **Artists consolidate by PARSED credit**
    (2026-07-03, `src/artist-credit.ts`): a vocabulary of solo-proven names splits compound
    credits ("Drake & Future" → both; "Earth, Wind & Fire" stays whole), multi-indexed so a
    collab lands under every credited artist (placement toggle: FUTURE-SETTINGS §19). True
    catalog artist identity is still the post-v1 hydrate below.
  - **Search** ([SEARCH.md](SEARCH.md)) — standalone sectioned discovery (songs/albums/artists/
    playlists), enrichment piggyback, transient + materialized catalog tracks.
  - **Playlists** ([PLAYLISTS.md](PLAYLISTS.md)) — Apple mirror + local store; overview → detail;
    New Playlist, Add to Playlist ▸ submenu, remove-track, empty-only delete. **Folders**
    (2026-07-03, §3a): manual folders + kind auto-clusters (Your Playlists / Apple Mixes /
    From Apple Music) as collapsible sections under the Folders sort; Move to Folder ▸ files
    locals AND mirrors (local metadata, zero Apple calls). Remaining: rename +
    drag-reorder (Rust commands exist), non-empty delete, mosaic covers, gated export.
  - **Queue** (`qcard.ts`) + **History** (`history-card.ts`) — Now Playing + Up Next / session
    play log; shared row markup (`queue-rows.ts`).
  - **Rewind** ([DEETS-REWIND.md](DEETS-REWIND.md)) — listening leaderboard (stat × time-window)
    over the play-event log.
  - **Radio** ([STATIONS.md](STATIONS.md)) — Apple's live / My Station / Discovery / genre
    stations as shelves (Recently Played · For You · Live · Genres); activate → **radio-mode
    playback** (station queue owned by MusicKit; break-out to a finite queue at the song
    boundary; transport caps + LIVE marker; station plays populate History/Rewind durably).
    Data: `radio.ts` + `radio_live`/`radio_my_station`/`radio_discovery`/`radio_genres`/
    `radio_genre_stations`/`radio_seed_station`/`catalog_song_artist` in `apple.rs`. **Seeded
    "Start Station"** right-click verb on every song surface + artists (Search, and Library
    Artists tiles via a lazy two-hop song→artist-id resolve — `src/start-station.ts`, gated
    builders, session-cached). **The own-station generator engine (Deezer BPM, scope toggle,
    thumbs) is DROPPED** — Apple curated is the whole radio story; §4 of the spec is
    research-record only.
- **Album Color** ([ALBUM-COLOR.md](ALBUM-COLOR.md)): real Apple palettes → `--album-*` runtime
  roles → the rotating Now-Playing aurora (Glass-only display).
- **Add to Library** ([FAVORITES.md](FAVORITES.md)): ➕ add a catalog song/album to iCloud Music
  Library, gated behind the **Library Add** settings toggle (default off), on Search / Playlists /
  **Queue / History** right-click menus (incl. the now-playing hero). Apple's API is add-only.

### Not built yet ⬜
- **♥ Favorites** — the love-only ♥ (Apple `PUT +1`) + local mirror + ♥ on Now Playing / menus.
  Parked, explicitly not the next step (user's call). **Ratings / 👎 are off the roadmap.**
- **Real album/artist data + artist photos in the Library card** — Library's Albums/Artists are
  derived from song artwork + initials (Search's artist drill already shows real photos). Scoped
  2026-07-03: **bigger than it looks** — the Artists overview shows hundreds at once, so lazy
  per-touch enrichment can't fill it (needs an eager one-time backfill, a deliberate exception
  to the enrichment doctrine with a §14-style opt-out) *and* it needs new schema (artist cache
  table), so it should bundle with the deferred schema-versioning work as one post-v1 pass.
  (Start Station on artist tiles does NOT wait for this — shipped via the lazy two-hop resolve.)
- **CLI / local-agent control** · **mini/max surface compositions** · **SMTC / global hotkeys** ·
  **virtualized scrolling** · **playlist rename / drag-reorder / export UX**.

## Known gotchas
- **No in-app OAuth popups** (Tauri/WebView2) — auth is browser-loopback by design (via
  `tauri-plugin-opener`, cross-platform); don't try to "fix" `authorize()` in the webview.
- **Liberation + skin fonts aren't on Windows** — bundled locally; the loopback page serves them
  too (embedded) so it matches the app.
- **Dev-oriented paths**: secrets/cache resolve from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`; release needs them in
  proper app dirs + the MUT in Windows Credential Manager. `dev-dumps/` holds **real account
  data** — gitignored, don't commit.
- **Playback transport races (MusicKit)** — three load-bearing rules, all in `player.ts`:
  - `changeToMediaAtIndex` **already starts playback**: never `play()` after it, and never call
    `changeToMediaAtIndex(0)` on a fresh queue (setQueue sits at 0 — the call makes MusicKit
    double-play against itself). `play()` belongs only on the pos-0 path, guarded by `!isPlaying`.
  - **Leaving a station needs `stop()`, not `pause()`** — a paused continuous controller stays
    primed to advance and AbortErrors the next `setQueue`. The station break-out loads with
    `stopFirst` + `noBack` (block at index 0, clean pos-0 path).
  - MusicKit re-issues `play()` on its **own un-awaited promise chains** during transitions,
    surfacing benign "Uncaught (in promise)" races we can't try/catch. A scoped
    `unhandledrejection` filter (`installMusicKitRejectionFilter`) swallows exactly two messages
    (`play() without a previous stop()/pause()`, `interrupted by a new load request`); everything
    else propagates.
- **Stale catalog ids reject whole feed batches** — `setQueue`/`playNext`/`playLater` are
  all-or-nothing; the player self-heals (session denylist + library-id fallback + rebuild/retry;
  `player:deadIds` diag). See [QUEUE.md §Dead ids](QUEUE.md).
- **Catalog tracks resolve through two layers** — the track-store `transient` map (session
  display) and Rust `source='seen'` rows (durable stats joins). `handlesFrom` feeds both on every
  play; `loadTracks` ingests seen rows at startup. Station plays go through `stationFollow`, whose
  gate skips only the **station container** (`ra.…`) item — NOT on kind/type (station-fed songs
  don't reliably report `kind:"song"`, and gating on it silently dropped every station play from
  history). If a catalog/station song shows "Unknown", that funnel broke, not the queue/log.
- **Model-follow keys off `music.queue.position`** (replays `advance()`/`previous()` on position
  change, suppressed during (re)loads via `loadingContext`, and off entirely in radio `mode`). If
  a MusicKit build reports position differently, fall back to matching `nowPlayingItem` by id.
- **Covers self-heal — don't add per-`<img>` onerror** — emit the `<img>` with a bare `data-art`
  marker; one capture-phase listener in `artwork-heal.ts` owns all retry (backoff + cache-bust +
  focus/visibility resume sweep). Chromium negative-caches a failed cover, so this is the only
  thing that recovers a sleep/wake-killed image.
- **Transport latency to cover up** — nav within MusicKit's window is gapless; anything **outside**
  it (rewind past the backlog, seek, scrub a DRM stream) forces a fresh `setQueue` and **buffers**.
  Needs a UX cover-up (loading state / optimistic icon), not a silent freeze. See [UX-COVERUPS.md](UX-COVERUPS.md).
- **Collection-card CSS traps** — the list/grid density hook is `data-grid`, NOT `data-density`
  (the buttons use `data-density`; reusing it makes the click handler swallow every tile click).
  Restore scroll *after* a pane mounts (in `slide()`), never while detached. `.coll-pane`'s
  transform traps `position: fixed`, so Sort/View popovers **portal to `<body>`**. Every card
  renders music through **`musicCell`** (row-vs-tile + density in one place) — keep new cards on it.
- **Added-Date needs a re-sync** — old cache rows lack `addedRank` until a refresh re-fetches with
  `sort=dateAdded`.

---

## Key decisions (the "why")
- **Data ≠ playback** — library fetching is plain REST (no DRM); the whole data layer was built
  without touching the DRM question.
- **Full-song DRM plays in WebView2** (confirmed) — MusicKit JS in the renderer, MUT injected
  directly. The MUT necessarily reaches the renderer for this one path.
- **Queue model is the source of truth**, decoupled from MusicKit; the player feeds MusicKit a
  bounded window (cheap setQueue + gapless play) and mirrors position back. Lightweight handles
  (ids), not full Tracks — cheap on huge libraries; metadata resolves via the shared track store.
- **Normalization in a Rust `MusicProvider` trait** — UI is provider-agnostic (a second provider
  slots behind the same seam; only playback is MusicKit-specific).
- **Unified `Track`** with both IDs optional (not split library/catalog types).
- **Persisted SQLite cache + sync-on-open** (stale-while-revalidate) — instant launches, offline
  browse; ~76 polite calls per refresh.
- **Loopback browser auth** as the permanent flow, not a workaround.
